# ElysiaBot
Discord bot built on DiscordJS by James Pierce

.gitignore ignores all Node package information, as well as the conf.js file. 
Conf.js is where your bot's token is stored, along with the prefix you want the bot to respond to.
The bot does not currently respect the prefix.

The ElysiaBot.service file is an example of how to set up an example service file for Linux using Systemd.
This file can be modified and used to run the bot automatically on startup and outside a terminal.
